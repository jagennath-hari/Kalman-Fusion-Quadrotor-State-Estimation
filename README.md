# Kalman Fusion: Quadrotor State Estimation
To estimate the state of a quadrotor using different sensor a roboust state estimation technique is required. The gold-standard Kalman Filter was used to fuse data from sensors such as Intertial Measurement Unit(IMU), Vicon(Motion tracking cameras) and Visual Odometry(Optical Flow). The entire project has been divided into $3$ parts.
